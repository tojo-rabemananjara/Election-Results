# Election Results
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to practice using the numpy and matplotlib python modules. Survey responses on a subset of a population of 10000 are provided, each preferenced either toward Ceballos or Kerrigan. Prediction % of outcome is calculated and compared against the actual outcome of 54%. Histograms of binomial distribution sample models are generated to show the likelyhood of Ceballos losing based on the current surveys, and if the number of surveys was instead 700 rather than just 33, but the predicted % outcome was still the same as in the original survey. The second binomial distribution histogram is created to demonstrate that predictions based on surveys increases when the number of people surveyed increases.
